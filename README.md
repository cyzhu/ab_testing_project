**Highlight of my work**
- Theoratically understand and explain of core concept of AB test and how to calculate the sample size. Check the notebook to see more details.
- Recommendation and further possible analysis in Section 3.4 of the notebook.
- Proposed potential improvements for this type of experiment in the future.
